# L-invariants
This repository contains code to compute L-invariants of modular forms using p-adic L-functions following the algorithms in

    John Bergdall, Robert Pollack, L-invariants via p-adic L-functions: computations and a distribution conjecture, preprint.

It also contains data of the p-adic valuations of L-invariants of thousands of modular forms at various levels typically dividing a product of small primes along with the data of the residual representation of the corresponding form.
