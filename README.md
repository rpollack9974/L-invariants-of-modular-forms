# $\mathcal L$-invariants of modular forms
This repository contains:

(1) code to compute L-invariants of modular forms using p-adic L-functions following the algorithms in

    John Bergdall, Robert Pollack. New phenomena for L-invariants of modular forms. Preprint.

(2) the data of the p-adic valuations of L-invariants of thousands of modular forms at various levels typically dividing a product of small primes along with the data of the residual representation of the corresponding form.

(3) scatter plots visualizing the data of slopes of L-invariants versus the weight
